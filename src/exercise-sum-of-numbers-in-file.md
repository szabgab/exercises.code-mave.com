# Sum of numbers in a file

Let's implement something slightly useful.

In this exercise we have a file called `numbers.txt` that has numbers in it.
Each line is a number.

Our aim is to add the numbers and print the result.


```ruby
{{#include examples/data/numbers.txt }}
```

Expected result is 126.
