Some simple exercises and several project ideas to practice programming.


When learning a programming language, the most important thing is to practice.
Here are some exercises you can do. For each exercise, as time permits, I am going to
add instructions specific to some programming languages,
but these exercises can be solved in almost any other programming language.

Once you feel comfortable with the exercises you can pick one of the more complex [projects](/projects) as well.
